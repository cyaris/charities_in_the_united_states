# charities_in_the_united_states

I used scrapy to gather data on charities in the United States, and then practiced supervised machine learning with Scikit-learn. Models used included linear regression, logistic regression, ridge regression, lasso regression, k-nearest neighbors, k-neighbors regressor, k-means clustering, decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines.
